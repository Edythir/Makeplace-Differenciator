Navigate to your .list.txt file in Makeplace/Saves
Copy everything between 
     Furniture     
=====================

And

        Dyes        
=====================

Your text files should look like this with no empty linebreaks:

Allagan Commerce Node Permit: 1
Allagan Resupply Node Permit: 1
Alpine Breakfast: 2
Apothecary's Workbench: 1

Neither "===" or "Furniture" at the top should be included in the file.

The list.txt of your old build that you have currently and want to add to should be copied into "Old List.txt"
The list.txt of your new build that you made in Makeplace and want to import should go into "New List.txt"

Run the differencer.py script with either IDLE, VSCode or any other compiler of your choice.

If the program is successful, "Purchase List.txt" should have all the things you need to buy. 

"Debug.txt" is included for troubleshooting purposes.
